- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @magnusmccune

- You can find my blog at [magnusmccune.com](https://magnusmccune.com), where I post a mix of technical and less practical thoughts
- You can find my professional information on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/magnusmccune/)
- You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Magnus_McCune) for the occasional quip

- You can find any upcoming events or recordings of past events [here](https://magnusmccune.com/public-speaking/)

This github account is a replacement for my previous [@m3labs-io](https://github.com/m3Labs-io) which was intended for company use.
I want to create a better seperation between that code and my personal code.
